# M1 Thesis: Clustering and Variable Selection

This repository contains the Master 1 thesis titled **"Which variables are important for clustering?"**. Authored by **Sixtine Sphabmixay, Josue Kamdem Kamwa, and Harivola Rajaonah**, the thesis explores methods for clustering and variable selection in the context of Gaussian mixture models and is written in French.

## Contents

### Thesis
- **File**: `M1_Thesis_Clustering.pdf`  
  The complete thesis document provides a comprehensive exploration of:
  - The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its application in clustering.
  - Penalized EM for variable selection.
  - Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection.
  - Case studies on synthetic and real datasets.

## Abstract

Unsupervised learning is a data analysis method used to discover hidden structures in datasets without predefined labels. Clustering, a key method in this domain, groups similar data points into clusters. The thesis focuses on Gaussian mixture models, which assume data within each cluster follows a normal distribution.

The document details:
- The EM algorithm and its penalized version for clustering and variable selection.
- The use of BIC to select the optimal number of clusters.
- Applications to datasets, including Old Faithful and DataMice, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed approaches.
